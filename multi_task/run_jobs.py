""" This file allows multiple jobs to be run on a server. After each job, an 
	email is sent to notify desired people of its completion.

	Must specify a text job file that contains the names and commands for each 
	job. Each job has 4 lines, containing: 
		1) the name, 
		2) the command, 
		3) the location of a file where the job output should be saved, 
		4) a blank line.

	An example job file format is as follows:

		Job1
		python job.py path1 arg1
		path/output1.txt

		Job2
		python job.py path2 arg2
		path/output2.txt

	Usage: python run_jobs.py jobs.txt
